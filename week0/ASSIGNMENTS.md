## ASSIGNMENT - Parameters

Pick a musical constraint/parameter, make a piece of music which explores that dimension. 1-2 minutes. Email me an audio recording and a brief description including what parameter you composed with. Could be low-tech/no-tech. Please encode it as an mp3. I like [this](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xld/) mp3 encoder if you don't already have one.

### Yurika Mulase - Two Six Eight 

Misunderstood the assignment a bit but I created 8 chords consisting of sixths and seconds and used 2 different random number generators to determine which chord to play (1-8) and for how long (1-6 beats).

Marc and Yurika made a website that produces a melody when you scroll down while showing a man journeying from the moon back down to Earth. Our parameters were to create a music-box melody in p5. It is also in the unusual key of A Dorian.
